# AWS Designs

I created the following designs as Cloud Computing Design

## üóÑÔ∏è Data Storage Design
Objective: Design a scalable and secure storage solution for operational data.

The storage design ensures that all raw data is efficiently stored in **AWS S3 Buckets**, allowing for scalability and secure access. This design supports the ingestion of various operational data from different sources, with proper organization to facilitate further processing.
